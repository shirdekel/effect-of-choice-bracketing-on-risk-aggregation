(ref:abstract) Aggregating the risk of a series of decisions reduces the overall
risk compared to when each decision is considered individually -- the logic
behind diversified investment strategies. Most experimental research on a series
of risky decisions provides participants with immediate feedback for each
individual choice before presenting the subsequent gamble -- a task-structure
that inhibits the possibility of risk aggregation. In real-life business
decisions, feedback is usually not seen until a significant delay with many more
business decisions made in the interim. This decision-making sequence has the
potential for systematic risk aggregation. However, it is unclear how people
determine what decisions cluster together such that those decisions' risks
become aggregated. In the current work, we presented experimental participants a
series of scenarios describing potential investments, and investigated multiple
ways to support clustering or bracketing choices together. We found that showing
a distribution of outcome probabilities without inter-trial feedback reduced
risk aversion. Further, we found mixed evidence for an effect of similarity of
projects, and found only minimal evidence that viewing projects together and
awareness of the number of projects encourages aggregation. These results
suggest that risk aggregation is hard to facilitate, at least in laypeople,
without first aggregating the options for them.
